6.  To get the Domain and range of the predicate and the literals that we have chosen
7.  Add the domain and range to the predicate by cross checking the questionMatch attribute
8.  To create the query with Predicate along with the domain and range, and filter it based on the literal.
9.  To create a class for the answers that will contain the answers objects, such as the answer, URI, etc etc..
